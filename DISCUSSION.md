There are a lot more things I would have liked to have done here as I was limited by the time box
  * Given more time, would have moved display table into own component.
  * Ideally for a large set of data you would want to have some sort of an index table that
    allows faster text searching
  * There should probably be some sort of checking to make sure there are enough characters
    in each search field so there aren't too many results returned
  * pagination should be added, can do it in DB or on client
  * search likely should be case insensitive
  * auto-complete for name and city would be nice
  * specialties could be moved to database
